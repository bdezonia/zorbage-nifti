Original Intent</font></b>
<br>

The idea that grew into the NIfTI-1 format originated as a random
thought on how to get various pieces of well-established FMRI software to work
together with the least amount of tinkering.  Since the
<a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/ANALYZE75.pdf">ANALYZE<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;7.5 format</a>
is extremely simple, widely used in the FMRI community, and contains
some unused or little-used spaces, this format was a logical place to start.
The idea was to take the ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5 header, squeeze some extra fields
into it, and get everyone in the DFWG to agree to support it.  Since the
people in the room included John Ashburner
(<a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">SPM</a>),
Steve Smith
(<a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/">FSL</a>), and myself
(<a href="http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni">AFNI</a>),
I&nbsp;figured that if the three of us could agree to use such a
hybrid format—<i>for both read and write</i>—the rest of the FMRI world would perforce come along.
</p>

<p>
Roughly speaking, the two goals of the NIfTI-1 format development were:
</p><ul>
 <li> To add information to the header that will be useful for functional
      neuroimaging (especially FMRI) data analysis and display.
 </li><li> To maintain compatibility with non-NIfTI-aware ANALYZE 7.5
      compatible software.
</li></ul>
Of course, these goals are somewhat in conflict.  The principal
reason for writing this document is to explain the trade-offs that were
made, and to capture the reasoning involved before it slips away
into "the mystic chords of memory".
<p></p>

<p>
Of course, nothing is as simple as it ought to be.
We had to agree upon which fields in
the ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5 header were really "little-used" and could be
over-written with other content.  And we had to agree upon what that
new content would be, and how it would be interpreted.  The issue
of coordinate systems was probably the most annoying, as usual.
And of course, there was the problem of keeping everything in the 348 byte
length of the ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5 header.
The result is not fully satisfying; however, I&nbsp;believe
it is a practical short-term solution for the image data file interoperability
problem in functional neuroimaging software.
</p>

<p>
The next section details the fields jettisoned from the ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5
header.
The remainder of this document then discusses the thinking behind each of the
conceptual components of the NIfTI-1 header.  Along the way, most of the
features of the NIfTI-1 format are at least outlined.  However, the comments
in the <a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/src/nifti1.h">NIfTI-1&nbsp;C&nbsp;header</a>
are more complete about most of these features.

What Was Sacrificed from ANALYZE 7.5
</font></b>
<br>
All of the fields marked as "unused" in the ANALYZE 7.5 header have
been taken for NIfTI-1 purposes.  In addition:
</p><ul>
<li><p>
    The <tt>compressed</tt> field has been renamed to <tt>slice_duration</tt>.
    <br>
    <i>Reasoning</i>: NIfTI-1 doesn't support compressed image data.
    Also, the meaning of <tt>compressed</tt> is quite unclear.
    </p>

</li><li><p>
    The <tt>verified</tt> field has been renamed to <tt>toffset</tt>.
    <br>
    <i>Reasoning</i>: The meaning of <tt>verified</tt> is obscure and
             we were unaware of any neuroimaging data analysis
             software that used this field.
    </p>

</li><li><p>
    All the <tt>data_history</tt> sub-structure after the <tt>aux_file</tt>
    field has been replaced by other contents.
    <br>
    <i>Reasoning</i>: The ANALYZE 7.5 documentation describes this entire
    sub-structure as "not required", and the meanings of most of its
    fields are unobvious, so deciding to alter it extensively was
    easy.  The only field within <tt>data_history</tt> that we considered
    keeping was <tt>orient</tt>, which was a integer code describing the
    spatial orientation of the 3D volume.  However, this field did not
    even allow encoding all 48 possible orthogonal orientations, and
    was seldom set or used in any software of which we were aware.  We
    therefore decided to completely replace the orientation specification
    in NIfTI-1.
    </p>

</li><li><p>
    The entire header structure is described in the
    <a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/src/nifti1.h">NIfTI-1&nbsp;C&nbsp;header</a> as a single C&nbsp;struct,
    rather than as a struct containing 3 sub-structs.  This cosmetic change
    is entirely for convenience in programming.
</p></li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
Various little-used ANALYZE 7.5 header fields have been kept in
the NIfTI-1 format.  These are marked as <tt>++UNUSED++</tt> in the
<a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/src/nifti1.h">NIfTI-1&nbsp;C&nbsp;header</a>.
One reason for keeping these fields is that we
weren't sure how necessary they are for ANALYZE 7.5 compatibility.
These unused-but-not-replaced fields
are <tt>data_type</tt>, <tt>db_name</tt>, <tt>extents</tt>,
<tt>session_error</tt>, <tt>glmin</tt>, <tt>glmax</tt>, and <tt>regular</tt>.
The contents of
none of these fields are specified by the NIfTI-1 standard.
A&nbsp;"proper" NIfTI-aware program should ignore these fields on input.
On output, <tt>regular</tt> should be set to the character <tt>'r'</tt>
for compatibility with ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5;
the other unused fields may be filled with zero bytes for safety.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>glmin</tt> and <tt>glmax</tt> fields are sometimes used to
hold the global data minimum and maximum values.  We decided against
mandating this use of these fields
because we are now allowing vector-valued data to be stored at each
voxel (in the 5<sup>th</sup> dimension of the image array).
The concept of data minimum and maximum doesn't apply to such data.
However, we did not "recycle" these fields since some ANALYZE 7.5
compatible software uses these values.  In a NIfTI-1 file, these fields
should either be set to&nbsp;0, or be set to the global minimum
and maximum of the image data.

<b><font color="#000044" size="+1">
Data Dimensionality
</font></b>
<br>
NIfTI-1, like ANALYZE 7.5, allows data to be stored on a regular
grid in 1..7 dimensions.  However, the NIfTI-1 standard adds some
specific interpretations to the dimensions that the ANALYZE 7.5 format
does not require.
</p>

<p>
The number of dimensions is stored in <tt>dim[0]</tt>, as in ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5;
this may be a value from 1..7.  (If this value is out of range, then that
is the signal that the header and data should be byte-swapped — pairwise for
<tt>short</tt> fields and quadwise for <tt>float</tt> fields.  If <tt>dim[0]</tt>
is still out of range after byte-swapping, then the file is not interpretable
as either a NIfTI-1 or ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5 file.  Note that this technique is
also the correct way to detect if an ANALYZE 7.5 file needs byte-swapping; the
practice of checking if <tt>sizeof_hdr=348</tt> for this purpose is not correct.)
</p>

<p>
As a shorthand, let <tt>N=dim[0]</tt>.
Then <tt>dim[1]..dim[N]</tt> contain the length of each dimension
in the <tt>N</tt>-dimensional image data array; again, as in ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5.
Unlike ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5,
in NIfTI1-1 each dimension index 1..5 is assigned a specific role.
Dimensions 1..3 are always interpreted as spatial dimensions,
here called <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, and&nbsp;<tt>z</tt>.  Dimension 4
is the time dimension, here called&nbsp;<tt>t</tt>.  Dimension 5 is
reserved for storing multiple values per spatiotemporal voxel
(e.g.,&nbsp;for storing <i>vector-valued</i> data).  NIfTI-1 does not specify
any uses for dimensions 6 and&nbsp;7.
</p>

<p>
The NIfTI-1 C header comments have a number of examples of how the
dimensional roles described above should be used.  For example, a&nbsp;spatially
1D time series of 3-vectors would have
</p><pre>  dim[0]=5  dim[1]=dim[2]=dim[3]=1  dim[4]=number_of_time_points  dim[5]=3</pre>
(Further discussion of how vector-valued data is to be stored can be found in a
later section.)
<p></p>

<p>
The reason for assigning fixed dimensional roles to each index 1..5 is
to make the interpretation of the file simple and consistent.  A&nbsp;program
can tell if an input file is time-dependent simply by checking if
<tt>dim[0]≥4</tt> and then if <tt>dim[4]&gt;1</tt>.
As another example,
a&nbsp;single slice FMRI experiment with 155 image acquisitions might have
</p><pre>  dim[0]=4  dim[1]=dim[2]=64  dim[3]=1  dim[4]=155</pre>
Although this is really 3 dimensional data <tt>(x,y,t)</tt>, it is easily
distinguished from a 3 dimensional volume <tt>(x,y,z)</tt>
because <tt>dim[4]&gt;1</tt> and <tt>dim[3]=1</tt>.
<p></p>

<p>
It may seem odd that some earlier dimensions might be&nbsp;1, while later
dimensions are greater than&nbsp;1.  In terms of the actual image data
storage, this makes no difference, since the data at the
5D index <tt>(a,b,c,d,e)</tt> is to be stored at byte offset
</p><pre> (<b>a</b>+<b>b</b>*dim[1]+<b>c</b>*dim[1]*dim[2]+<b>d</b>*dim[1]*dim[2]*dim[3]+<b>e</b>*dim[1]*dim[2]*dim[3]*dim[4])*bitpix/8</pre>
into the image data array, for <tt>a=0..dim[1]-1</tt>, <tt>b=0..dim[2]-1</tt>, etc.
In the spatially 1D time series example above, the only legal value for
<tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>c</tt> is&nbsp;0.  In this example, the
offset formula simplifies to
<pre> (<b>d</b>+<b>e</b>*dim[4])*bitpix/8</pre>
which is exactly the form one would get by storing the time axis in
dimension 1 and the vector components along dimension&nbsp;2.
Thus, there is no computational or storage efficiency loss to assigning
dimensional roles that result in leading dimensions being set to&nbsp;1.
<p></p>

<p>
There was some discussion in the DFWG about having an option to store
the vector values along dimension&nbsp;1.  The advantage of using this
option would be that data that "belongs" together in the same
spatiotemporal voxel would be stored contiguously in the data array.
Storing the vector values along dimension 5 means that such data can be
spaced quite far apart; for example, if <tt>dim[1]=dim[2]=dim[3]=100</tt>,
<tt>dim[4]=1</tt>, then each unit step along dimension 5 steps across
<tt>100000*bitpix/8</tt> bytes of image data.  On modern computer systems,
such non-local access can be quite slow if not programmed very carefully.
</p>

<p>
The reason we decided against this "vector-values along dimension&nbsp;1"
option is that such files would make no sense to a non-NIfTI-aware
program.  With dimensions 1..3 being assigned to space and dimension 4
to time, our hope is that most programs reading the ANALYZE 7.5 will
still be able to at least display NIfTI-1 files in some recognizable way.

<b><font color="#000044" size="+1">
Data Storage: <tt>.hdr/.img</tt> File Pairs and <tt>.nii</tt> Single Files
</font></b>
<br>
The ANALYZE 7.5 format famously stores a dataset in two files:
<tt>prefix.hdr</tt> to contain just the 348-byte header, and
<tt>prefix.img</tt> to contain just the binary image data.
(In principle, the image data could be stored in another filename,
which would be stored in header field <tt>db_name</tt>, but this
is very uncommon in the functional neuroimaging community.)
</p>

<p>
NIfTI-1 keeps the file pair storage strategy, in part to keep a measure
of compatibility with ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5.  Another reason for storing the
binary image data in a separate file is that it becomes easy to
load the data into memory using the Unix <tt>mmap()</tt> function.  This
function allow a program to map a file into memory space; the OS then
takes care of the I/O.
</p>

<p>
There are two principal reasons that a single file storage of a dataset
is desirable:
</p><ul>
 <li> Convenience in file copying, moving, and renaming operations.
 </li><li> Making it possible to link to a dataset file on a Web page;
      the creation of "helper" applications that can then display
      such files will make it possible for researchers to post
      3D and 4D neuroimaging data and results for easy viewing.
</li></ul>
The NIfTI-1 single file format is simply a catenation of the 348-byte
header and the binary image data.  However, the <tt>vox_offset</tt> field
in the header should be set to the byte offset in the file where the
image data starts.  (For ANALYZE 7.5 compatibility, <tt>vox_offset</tt>
is a <tt>float</tt> value.)  Clearly, the minimum value of <tt>vox_offset</tt>
is&nbsp;348.  In principle, it would be possible to increase <tt>vox_offset</tt>
and put non-standard data between the header and the image data.
This tempting practice is strongly discouraged.
<p></p>

<p>
To signal that a 348-byte header is NIfTI-1 compatible, the last 4 bytes
of this header comprise the <tt>magic</tt> field.  This field should have
one of these two values:
</p><ul>
 <li> <tt>"ni1\0"</tt> (hexadecimal: 6E 69 31 00) — indicates a NIfTI-1 dataset
      stored in <i>two</i> files;
 </li><li> <tt>"n+1\0"</tt> (hexadecimal: 6E 2B 31 00) — indicates a NIfTI-1 dataset
      stored in <i>one</i> file.
</li></ul>
If neither of these values is encountered, then the header is not NIfTI-1
compliant and should be treated as an ANALYZE 7.5 header.
The <tt>"1"</tt> in the <tt>magic</tt> strings indicates the NIfTI version.
The <tt>magic</tt> string is placed at the <i>end</i> of the header
since the widely-checked <tt>sizeof_hdr</tt> ANALYZE 7.5 field comes at
the beginning; we felt that modifying <tt>sizeof_hdr</tt> might too severely
break ANALYZE 7.5 compatibility.
<p></p>

<p>
The preferred NIfTI-1 suffix for such single files is <tt>.nii</tt>.
This was chosen because the more obvious <tt>.nif</tt> was already
spoken for;
cf.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icdatamaster.com/n.html">http://www.icdatamaster.com/n.html</a>.
On the plus side, "nii" can be pronounced as in
<a href="http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/grail/grail-13.htm">this movie scene</a>.
However, this filename suffix is <i>not</i> required; the ultimate decision about
whether the image data is in the same file as the header comes from
the <tt>magic</tt> field, not from the filename.

<b><font color="#000044" size="+1">
Data Scaling
</font></b>
<br>
For years, SPM has used the ANALYZE 7.5 <tt>funused1</tt> field as
a scaling factor; if the value stored therein is nonzero, then all
the image data is scaled by <tt>funused1</tt> before being used in
the program.  NIfTI-1 has formalized and extended this idea.
The <tt>funused1</tt> field is renamed to <tt>scl_slope</tt> and
the <tt>funused2</tt> field is renamed to <tt>scl_inter</tt>.
If <tt>scl_slope</tt> is nonzero, then a voxel value <tt>val</tt>
read from the file should be interpreted as
<tt>scl_slope&nbsp;*&nbsp;val&nbsp;+&nbsp;scl_inter</tt> inside the
program.  This scaling is to apply to all the values in the
dataset, <i>unless</i> the <tt>datatype</tt> is&nbsp;RGB.
</p>

<p>
In general, it is probably better to store floating point values as
floating point data, rather than try to compress them to 16-bit
<tt>short</tt>s or 8-bit <tt>byte</tt>s along with a global scaling factor.  However,
several DFWG members felt that providing a standard way of expressing
scaling was important, especially for backward compatibility.
</p>

<p>
<b><font color="#000044" size="+1">
Elementary Data Types
</font></b>
<br>
A large number of DFWG members felt it was important to provide a
"complete" set of elementary data type codes (stored in the
<tt>datatype</tt> header field).  The allowable <tt>datatype</tt> codes
have been extended to allow for 8..128 bit integer, float, and complex
values.  For more information, see
<a href="http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/dfwg/faq.html#Q12">FAQ&nbsp;#12</a>.
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of encoding more complicated structured types
to be stored at each voxel.  (The structured types allowed in ANALYZE 7.5
are complex numbers=<tt>float</tt> pairs and RGB colors=<tt>byte</tt> triples.)
The interpretation of dimension 5 as stored vector-values for each
spatiotemporal voxel partly elides this issue.  However, since each
value in the image binary data must have the same <tt>datatype</tt>,
it is impossible currently to store (say) an <tt>int</tt> and 3 <tt>float</tt>s
at each location.  Unfortunately, it seems to be impracticable to
encode such any reasonably general typing mechanism and at the same
time keep to the 348-byte header length compatibility requirement.

Storing Statistical Parametric Images
</font></b>
<br>
Direct imaging data (i.e., the output from a scanner) is only a fraction
of what is stored in functional neuroimaging data analyses.
A&nbsp;large quantity of derived datasets is created along the way.
Many of these are statistics of various kinds.  One goal of our efforts
was to provide a standard way to mark the values in a
dataset as being <i>t</i>-statistics,
<i>F</i>-statistics, etc., and to store the auxiliary parameters
(e.g.,&nbsp;degrees-of-freedom) that go with these parametric distributions.
</p>

<p>
"Meaning" is attached to the numbers in a dataset
by setting the <tt>intent_code</tt> field to a nonzero value.
Values of <tt>intent_code</tt> in the range 2..22 indicate that the
dataset numbers are drawn from various standard probability distributions.
Any particular distribution may have from 0 to 3 parameters.

It was my original intention that the statistical parameters for such a dataset
would be globally fixed in the header; for example, a&nbsp;dataset of t-statistics
with 23.7 degrees-of-freedom.  (This is the current status in AFNI.)
Several other members of the DFWG convinced me that allowing the parameters to
be voxel-dependent was an important feature.  Thus, NIfTI-1 allows a statistical
dataset to have its parameters specified in two different ways:
</p><ul>
  <li> If <tt>dim[5]=1</tt> (or if <tt>dim[0]&lt;5</tt>),
       then the parameters are global (voxel-independent)
       and are stored in <tt>intent_p1</tt>, <tt>intent_p2</tt>, and <tt>intent_p3</tt>.
  </li><li> If <tt>dim[5]&gt;1</tt>, then <tt>dim[5]</tt> should equal 1 plus the number
       of parameters for the <tt>intent_code</tt> distribution.  If we call <tt>e</tt>
       the index for the 5<sup>th</sup> dimension, then for each 4D voxel index
       <tt>(a,b,c,d)</tt>, the statistic itself is stored in the 5D location
       <tt>(a,b,c,d,e=0)</tt>, the first parameter in <tt>(a,b,c,d,e=1)</tt>, et cetera.
</li></ul>
These two methods allow for compact storage if the distributional parameters are
in fact global, but also allow for the more general case of non-global parameters.
Note that there is no provision for storing a <i>vector</i> of statistical values,
since the vector dimension 5 is taken to store distributional parameters.

Values of <tt>intent_code</tt> greater than 1000 are used to signal

<p>
The difference between "Displacement" and "General" vector is that <tt>intent_code=1006</tt> is used to
signal that the vectors stored at each location are a geometric displacement (or distortion).  This feature
can be used to encode nonlinear warps, for example.  <tt>intent_code=1007</tt> just signals that vectors
are stored at each location, but does not impute any more meaning to them (e.g.,&nbsp;this feature could
be used to store a diffusion-tensor derived tract direction at each location in space).
</p>

<p>
The "Point Set" <tt>intent_code</tt>'s function is to allow storage of random points in space; for
example, the nodes of a surface mesh.  The "Triangle&nbsp;Set" <tt>intent_code</tt>'s function
is to allow storage of integer triples that encode a surface mesh.  In both cases, <tt>dim[1]</tt>
would be set to the number of entries in the dataset.  The combination of a "Point&nbsp;Set" dataset
and a "Triangle&nbsp;Set" dataset would allow the specification of a surface mesh, where the indexes
stored in the "Triangle&nbsp;Set" dataset would indicate which nodes from the "Point&nbsp;Set"
dataset were in each triangle.
</p>

<p>
Numerous other specialty vector types could easily be devised.
Rather than get carried away, we
decided to stop here and see what comments we get.
All these features are frankly
experimental and tentative.

Code 1002 is for a custom set of labels; the integer values in the

<b><font color="#000044" size="+1">
Coordinate Systems and Data Orientation
</font></b>
<br>
The issue of specifying the orientation and location in space
of a volumetric dataset is moderately annoying.  On the one
hand, it seems basically trivial.  On the other hand, no one
agrees on what is the "right way" to do this.  The choices
in NIfTI-1 are the result of a compromise between John Ashburner,
Steve Smith, and myself, worked out via e-mail and
at the bar in the Marquis Marriott
during the 9<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting of the
<a href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/">OHBM</a>.
</p>

<p>
When dealing with a single volume, or a set of spatially
identical volumes, the orientation and location of the raster grid
are relatively unimportant when processing the data.
But in FMRI and other neuroimaging applications, one usually
needs to deal with sets of volumes acquired on different
grid sizes, in different orientations, and with different
coverage of the brain.  For example, one usually wants to
overlay low-resolution FMRI results onto high-resolution
MP-RAGE/SPGR type structural reference volumes.  To do this
correctly and automatically requires that the spatial
relationship between different volumes be encoded somehow.
</p>

<p>
One way to encode such relationships (adopted here) is to
postulate a master coordinate system, and then store the
location/orientation of each dataset with respect to that
master system.  Then the spatial relationship between any two
datasets can be found.  The basic such spatial relationship
question is,
"What value of <tt>(i,j,k)<sub>1</sub></tt>
in dataset #1 corresponds to a given
<tt>(i,j,k)<sub>2</sub></tt> in dataset&nbsp;#2?"
With a common master coordinate system, each dataset #p
contains a transformation from <tt>(i,j,k)<sub>p</sub></tt>
to <tt>(x,y,z)</tt>; call this transformation
<tt>(x,y,z)&nbsp;=&nbsp;T<sub>p</sub>[(i,j,k)]</tt>.
Then the answer to the basic question is
<tt>(i,j,k)<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;T<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup><big>[</big>T<sub>2</sub>[(i,j,k)<sub>2</sub>]<big>]</big></tt>.  When <tt>T<sub>p</sub></tt>
is an affine transformation, then <tt>T<sub>p</sub><sup>-1</sup></tt> is also
affine, and so is
<tt>T<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>T<sub>2</sub></tt>.
(The transformations stored in the NIfTI-1 header are affine.)
</p>

<p>
An alternative way encode the spatial relationship between
datasets (<i>not</i> adopted here) is to eschew the use
of an arbitrary master coordinate system.
Instead, the pairwise relationship
between any two datasets is stored separately.  This approach
is followed in FSL, where external files with names
like <tt>example_func2highres.mat</tt>
encode the spatial
transformation between the EPI data (<tt>example_func.hdr</tt>)
and the high-resolution anatomical volume (<tt>highres.hdr</tt>).
The main drawback to this scheme is that it is hard to
generalize to cases with many different types of images, each
gathered in a different way.  For this reason, we did not use
this approach in NIfTI-1.
</p>

<p>
NIfTI-1 allows the master coordinate system to be
labeled as one of the following:
</p><ul>
 <li> Scanner-based anatomical coordinates (e.g.,&nbsp;from the DICOM image header);
 </li><li> Scanner-based anatomical coordinates, realigned to some "truth"
 </li><li> Coordinates aligned to the Talairach-Tournoux Atlas;
      (e.g.,&nbsp;<tt>(0,0,0)</tt>=Anterior Commissure);
 </li><li> Coordinates aligned to the MNI-152 standard template.
</li></ul>
We agreed that <tt>(x,y,z)</tt> <i>always</i> refers to a coordinate system
where <tt>+x</tt>=Right, <tt>+y</tt>=Anterior, and <tt>+z</tt>=Superior.
(This is a right-handed system, unlike the ANALYZE 7.5 standard coordinates.)
Note that in the NIfTI-1 coordinate model,
<tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are the negative of DICOM standard
<tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> values.  We adopted this coordinate convention
since it is widely used (e.g.,&nbsp;in SPM and FSL), and is the basis for most
"activation" coordinates reported in the neuroimaging literature.
<p></p>

<p>
The NIfTI-1 format allows the storage of
<i>two</i> affine transformations from <tt>(i,j,k)</tt>
to <tt>(x,y,z)</tt>.
The first transformation ("qform") is intended to encode
the orthogonal orientation of the 3D volumes in the master
coordinate space.  The second transformation ("sform") is intended
to encode a general affine transformation to a standard space
(i.e.,&nbsp;Talairach-Tournoux or MNI-152).
Each transform can be useful in different contexts:
the "qform" for displaying the data on its original grid
(what the scanner reported), and
the "sform" for displaying the data scaled to a standard space.
For example, the "qform" can be constructed from the attributes
from a set of DICOM files; the "sform" can be computed and
inserted into the header later.  Image display software can
use either transform, depending on its needs.
</p>

<p>
To save space, the
"qform" orthogonal
transformation is encoded using a quaternion in the header file.
the "sform" general transformation is stored as a 4×3 matrix.
The details are described in the
<a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/src/nifti1.h">NIfTI-1&nbsp;C&nbsp;header</a> at length.
</p>

<p>
An important point is that the <tt>(x,y,z)</tt> value assigned by
the header transformations to a voxel 3D index <tt>(i,j,k)</tt>
refers to the <i>center</i> of the voxel.  This point was the subject
of some debate at the Marquis Marriott meeting.  The alternative
proposal was to define <tt>(x,y,z)</tt> as being a corner of a voxel,
where <tt>(i,j,k)=(0,0,0)</tt> would correspond to the outermost
corner of the first voxel in the dataset.  This proposal has the advantage
that the 3D bounding box of the volume is then given by
<tt>T([0,0,0])..T([dim[1]-1,dim[2]-1,dim[3]-1])</tt>, where again
<tt>T</tt> represents the affine transformation from
<tt>(i,j,k)</tt> to <tt>(x,y,z)</tt>.  After some mild debate, the
center proposal won the vote.  This is consistent with the custom
in scanner-supplied image headers (including DICOM), where pixel coordinates
invariably refer to the center.

MRI-Specific Image Information
</font></b>
<br>
Since FMRI is the most widely used functional neuroimaging technique,
and since the DFWG's charter from the main NIfTI committee was to
help make FMRI analysis software interoperable, several features in
the NIfTI-1 format are specialized for multislice echo-planar image (EPI)
acquisition:
</p><ul>
 <li> A field to specify which of <tt>(x,y,z)</tt> corresponds to
      the frequency, phase, and slice encoding directions.  This
      is essential information when trying to apply a magnetic field map
      to unwarp an echo-planar image.
 </li><li> A field to specify the amount of time required to gather a single
      slice.  Clustered acquisition schemes may have
      <tt>slice_duration*dim[slice_dim]</tt> less than <tt>pixdim[4]</tt>,
      with the rest of the TR=<tt>pixdim[4]</tt> time silent.
 </li><li> A field to indicate the slice acquisition order (e.g., interleaved).
      These last two fields are essential when trying to estimate
      hemodynamic delays from EPI time series.
</li></ul>
Obviously, more information about the data acquisition could be useful
in various circumstances.  We chose these attributes because they seemed
the most important for the near-term needs, as perceived by the DFWG.

Miscellaneous Notes
</font></b>
<br>
</p><ul>
 <li>
  The ANALYZE 7.5 fields <tt>cal_min</tt> and <tt>cal_max</tt> have been
  left untouched; however, the meaning of these values is not specifically
  defined by the NIfTI-1 standard.  One possible use is to map
  data values to some color display scale; for example, map
  values at (or below) <tt>cal_min</tt> to "black", values at or above
  <tt>cal_max</tt> to "white", and values in between linearly to intermediate
  colors.  Here, "black" and "white" can be the extreme ends of any color
  scheme, of course.

 </li><li>
   Integer types are implicitly assumed to be stored in twos-complement
   form.  Floating point types are implicitly assumed to be stored
   in IEEE-754 format (so that binary floats are interchangeable, with
   at most byte-swapping required).
   These assumptions should be valid for all modern
   microprocessors one is likely to encounter.

 </li><li>
   Explicit use in the header is made of the assumptions that
   <tt>sizeof(short)==2</tt> and <tt>sizeof(float)==4</tt>.
   Implicitly, we are also assuming that <tt>sizeof(int)==4</tt>,
   <tt>sizeof(double)==8</tt>, and that the complex types
   are stored with no padding.

 </li><li>
   We are assuming that there are only two byte orders possible,
   and that correctly swapping data values that occupy N bytes
   is done by swapping end-for-end (e.g.,&nbsp;<tt>ABCD</tt>&amp;harr<tt>DCBA</tt>).
   Also, we are assuming that the header and data are both stored
   in the same endian-ness, so that by examining <tt>dim[0]</tt> one can
   determine whether to byte swap the rest of the header <i>and</i>
   the image data.

Personal Comments
</font></b>
<br>
Although I am the author of
<a href="http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni">AFNI</a> and its
<a href="http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/README.attributes">file format</a>,
very little of that material has crept into the NIfTI-1 format.
About the only place where my AFNI work has <i>directly</i> impacted the new
format is my insistence on including intent codes for indicating that
the values in a dataset are drawn from various common probability distributions.
The actual codes used for this are drawn from the AFNI format.
</p>

<p>
I'm not particularly enamored of the AFNI file format any more.
I&nbsp;"designed" it in about an hour in July 1994.  I&nbsp;would prefer
an XML-based format to become a <i>de facto</i> FMRI standard, but
that doesn't seem to be an option at this time (i.e.,&nbsp;the enthusiasm
level for this in the DFWG was non-existent).
I&nbsp;chose to put forward
the idea of adapting the ANALYZE 7.5 format to FMRI needs because I
felt this would be the most likely way to make progress in a short
amount of time.  Here, "progress" is defined as being able to get the
major FMRI software packages to exchange data without the users
experiencing <i>too</i> much anguish.  To my mind, the biggest issue
was (and is) coordinate systems.
</p>

<p>
One of the FAQs is
<a href="http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/dfwg/faq.html#Q2">"Why didn't the committee choose the DICOM format?"</a>  My personal answer to this question includes the following points:
</p><ul>
<li> DICOM is far too complex to understand easily.
     A&nbsp;reasonably competent programmer should be able to write
     a NIfTI-1 read/write set of functions in a day or so.  (Less if they
     start with <a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/src/">the existing software</a>.)
</li><li> DICOM doesn't allow storage of floating point values.
     (This "feature" is perhaps the biggest objection in my mind.)
</li><li> We'd need to add a bunch of attributes to describe neuroimaging-specific needs
     (e.g.,&nbsp;statistical codes and parameters; vector-valued datasets).
     These additions would make NIfTI-1 datasets not particularly
     readable in standard DICOM programs.
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
Another obvious question is "Why didn't the DFWG work a little longer and
come up with a more comprehensive solution?"  The answer is that we started
down this path (and are continuing these efforts), but the road to a
better file format is much longer than it appears .  By working within the
constraints of "turbo-charging" an existing format, we were able to
make some limited progress immediately.
